Open Telemetry
    - System.Diagnostic, ActivitySource
    - .NET Shim and why it is not ideal for libraries
    - Configure Resources
    - Automatic vs Manual instrumentation (Being intentional)
    - Smapling (Storage-based sampling)

Event Sourcing
    - Storage Pattern (Marely)
    - Store state transitions instead of actual state (events vs state)
    - DDD - Event Storming - Business Processes - Actions and Reactions
    - EDA != ES. In event sourcing, events are the source of truth, not only notifications.

CQRS
    - Based on CQS (Command change state only, Query read state only)
    - In CQRS, usually C/Q storage are separated and the state is send throught events with projections (optimized view of the data)

SQLServer
    - Automatic Concurrency Checking
    - Write different pages for the same table
    - Cost of occational page splits

SignalR
    - Fallback to long polling and regular polling
